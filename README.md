# S M Mahidur Rahman — Portfolio

This folder contains a single-file website (`index.html`) with assets.
Open `index.html` in a browser, or host the folder on any static host.

## Edit these first
- **Email**: search for `const to =` in `index.html` and set your real email (`your.email@example.com` is placeholder).
- **Social links**: replace `YOUR_GITHUB`, `YOUR_LINKEDIN`, etc.
- **About/Education/Skills/Projects/Hobbies/Certifications**: update text blocks.
- **Resume**: replace `resume.pdf` with your real file (same name).

## Assets
- `images/profile.jpg` — set from your uploaded photo.
- `images/og.jpg` — used for link previews (currently same as profile).

## Deploy
Upload everything as-is to your hosting. The site is a single HTML file with no build step.
